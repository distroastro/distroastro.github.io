<h1>Location Settings Help</h1>
<h2>Current Location</h2>
<p>
This section tells you your current system location. This information is read from the file <cite>/etc/location</cite>.
</p>
<h3>Location Box</h3>
<p>
This box displays the following information about your location:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Latitude</li>
<li>Longitude</li>
<li>Elevation</li>
<li>Street</li>
<li>Area</li>
<li>City</li>
<li>Region</li>
<li>Country</li>
<li>Country Code</li>
<li>Timezone ID</li>
<li>Timezone Name</li>
<li>Timezone Abbr</li>
<li>UTC Offset</li>
<li>DST Offset</li>
</ul>
<p>
This same information can be found by running '<code>location -a</code>' on the command line.
</p>
<h3>Show Map</h3>
<p>
To see a map of your system location, click the button called <button onclick="alert('This is just a Help file. Please click it on the actual applet.')">Show Map</button>.
</p>
<p>
This will open Google Maps and will require an Internet connection.
</p>
<h2>Location Settings</h2>
<p>
This sections lets you control if the system and application location information is updated automatically.
</p>
<h3>Automatically update application location settings</h3>
<p>
If this is checked, the location settings of each supported application is automatically updated upon user login. For example, upon opening a supported program such as Stellarium, its home location will be your system location.
</p>
<p>
If it is unchecked, the location settings of supported applications remain unchanged from the last known value.
</p>
<p>
To update them immediately, click the button called <button onclick="alert('This is just a Help file. Please click it on the actual applet.')">Update Now</button>.
</p>
<p>
This can also be done by running '<code>autolocation set</code>' on the command line.
</p>
<h3>Automatically update system location settings</h3>
<p>
If this is checked, the location settings found in <cite>/etc/location</cite> is updated automatically when the computer is connected to the Internet.
</p>
<p>
If it is unchecked, the location settings remain unchanged from the last known value.
</p>
<p>
To update it immediately, click the button called <button onclick="alert('This is just a Help file. Please click it on the actual applet.')">Update Now</button>.
</p>
<p>
This can also be done by running '<code>sudo update-location</code>' on the command line.
</p>
<h3>Manually set system location settings</h3>
<p>
The current GUI does not have a way to manually set system location. To set it, run the following on the command line:
</p>
<p>
<code class="bash">sudo update-location LAT LONG</code>
</p>
<p>
where LAT and LONG are given in decimal degrees. For example, use the decimal 14.5 to represent 14Â° 30'.
